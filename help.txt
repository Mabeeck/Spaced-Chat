This is a reminder to myself from myself that way I won't have to suffer again

Java 21 or 22 required to compile for 1.21.x (Java 23 is incompatible)
Delete properties file in ./gradle/
Configure Java version in ./build.gradle
For support of versions 1.20.x and 1.19.x compile for one of these versions with Java 17 (Configure this in ./gradle.properties)
Java 22 files cannot be launched from the normal launcher! Compile with an older version.
If implementing support for new minecraft version make sure to also update ./src/main/resources/fabric.mod.json

Test in the actual minecraft launcher before uploading!
